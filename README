   sudo perl -MAcme::Tools -e Acme::Tools::self_update

WHAT

Acme::Tools is a collection of more or less useful subs lumped together in one module.

All subs are exported so beware of name space pollution. (What did you expect from an acme module?)

To import just a selection of subs:

 use Acme::Tools qw(pivot random in mix brex curb ansicolor);

See documentation for more.


DEPENDENCIES

This module in itself does not require these modules to be used, but
some of the subs will  require  them upon first call:

 require Compress::Zlib;
 require Digest::MD5;
 require String::Similarity;
