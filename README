WHAT

Acme::Tools is a collection of more or less useful subs lumped together in one module.

All subs are exported, so beware of name space pollution. (What did you expect of an acme module?)

To import just some subs, do:

 use Acme::Tools qw(pivot ansicolor);

See documentation for more.


DEPENDENCIES

This module in itself does not require these modules to be used, but
some of the subs in  Acme::Tools  require  them:

 require Compress::Zlib;
 require Digest::MD5
